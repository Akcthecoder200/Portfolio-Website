# Personal Portfolio (Week 1 - HTML Basics)

This is a simple personal portfolio page built as part of an HTML basics lesson.

Files:

- `index.html` — main HTML file with semantic sections (header, main, footer)
- `css/style.css` — minimal styles for layout and readability
- `js/script.js` — tiny JS for contact form handling and dynamic year
- `assets/profile.svg` — placeholder profile graphic

How to open:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or open from VS Code Live Server).
2. Inspect elements using your browser dev tools (F12) to see the structure.

Validate:

- Use https://validator.w3.org to validate `index.html`.

Next steps:

- Add more projects and links
- Learn basic CSS layout (flexbox)
- Host on GitHub Pages when ready
